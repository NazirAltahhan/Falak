  <h3> Firstly the work system at Falak Educational Center:</h3>
    The Falak Center has a system that they follow in dealing with students who come to the center , which is as follows:<br>

      They initially examine the student in Arabic , by reading and writing together , and if the student does not know , they place him in the class in which he will learn to read and write, which is called (the Noorani rule).<br>
      Then after learning the entire book of Al-Nouraniyah , the student will be able to read from the Qur’an on his own , with good recitation.<br>
      After this batch of students graduates , they sort them into the previously existing circles to memorize and master the Qur’an, or if the circles are full and the number of graduates is good , they bring a professor for them and begin their journey by memorizing and mastering the Qur’an.<br>

    -Education in these episodes is for several things:<br>
      1- Memorizing and confirming the Qur’an.<br>
      2- Teaching the basics of religion , including jurisprudence and doctrine.<br>
      3- Raising good morals , respect for knowledge and scholars, cooperation with others , patience in learning, and love of his friends.<br>
      4-Learn the science of Tajweed in a practical and theoretical way.<br>
      5- Recreational activities inside the center and outside it sometimes.<br>
      6- Questions and competitions.<br>
 </b></p></div>

 <div><p><b>
 <h3> Secondly as for the center’s other activities:</h3>
      1- Circles for adults to memorize the Qur’an.<br>
      2- Elite circles , which are diligent students who have the highest potential and abilities to memorize and understand quickly.<br>
      3- There is a special course for students who have completely memorized the Holy Qur’an , It is a one-year program:<br>
       It is divided into stages , and each stage includes activities inside the center , such as lunch with teachers , competitions , and evening parties , and outside the center , such as swimming and playing ball.<br>
       When each stage ends , there are rewards and prizes , and the new stage begins to give the student the motivation and passion to be able to become in the top positions.<br>
       Here , the student has obtained a certificate in the Holy Qur’an and learned the foundations of his religion , so that he can walk in his world in the light of the words of the Prophet and the Sunnah of his Prophet , may God bless him and grant him peace.<br> 
</b></p></div>

<div><p><b>
   <h3> Third As for other activities , other than Qur’an circles:</h3>
      1-There are weekly lessons and lectures.<br>
      2-Lectures by sheikhs from outside the center every month or two.<br>
      3-Intensive scientific lectures , sometimes 4 hours and sometimes a whole day , which they live with knowledge.<br>
      4-There are introductory legal courses for converting to religion , which last for 4 months , from which the student graduates as a Muslim person who maintains a sound and correct belief , who understands the basics of his religion , understands some methods of interpretation , and ponders some hadiths.<br>
       In this course , the student also learns the basics of Arabic grammar , so that he can understand the Qur’an , learn the knowledge of Tajweed , and memorize during this period what is available to him from the Qur’an with proficient sheikhs.<br>

    </b></p></div>
    
    <div><p><b>
    <h3>Fourthly there are also activities for the center staff:</h3>
      Paying attention to professors and sheikhs , training and developing them through courses , lectures , and activities outside and inside the center.<br>
       All of these things that we mentioned apply to the men’s and women’s sections , of course , with all activities and events , but only the working hours differ.

<div><p><b>
      We thank God Almighty for having provided us with this center to help Muslims not to lose the Arabic language , and for having provided people with a good environment in which they can place their children so that they may be good, reformers, morals, and memorizers of the Book of God.<br>
      By God this is a great blessing for which we must thank God , and praise be to God , Lord of the Worlds.
