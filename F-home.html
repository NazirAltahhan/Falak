    <h1 ><i>Welcome to your Falak Educational Center</i></h1>
    <p>
    <b>
      One of the most severe afflictions that befell the Arab Islamic countries after the wars and revolutions that took place in them is the displacement of Muslim people around the world , especially European countries and Turkey.<br>
      What this displacement in this country has led to is the loss of the Arabic language , the inability to learn the basics of religion that every Muslim must know , and the loss of the Friday sermon in Arabic.<br>
      Those who were most affected by this matter were the emerging youth and young children, The young man became ignorant of the matters of his religion, which we call axioms and axioms , and the children became as if their primary language was the language of the country to which he immigrated with his parents or was born in outside his hometown , to the point that the people of the country itself think they are not , Foreigners to them, because of their accent in the language as if he was a person from their country.<br>
      But thanks to God Almighty and His blessings upon us , He has made reformers available to us in Turkey , especially in Istanbul (in ancient Constantinople) , who understood this great problem , They began as quickly as possible to open Arab-Islamic centres, concerned with:
      By delivering the Friday sermon in Arabic , teaching the Arabic language to children and young people who missed learning their language in their country due to the war, and opening special courses to teach the basics of the true Islamic religion , in various fields , including doctrine , jurisprudence , interpretation , hadith , and biography , and are available to all ages, for men and women.<br>
      This Falak Educational Center is one of the best centers in the city of Istanbul.<br> It was established five or six years ago , and it has a staff with good educational attainment , excellent experience , and experience that has also increased over the course of these years.<br>
       This is an overview of the center and its lessons , seminars , courses , lectures , and activities.<br>
      We ask God to reward them with all goodness on our behalf , and to make them steadfast in this gap on which they are standing .
